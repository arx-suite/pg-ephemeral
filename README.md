## Why PG Ephemeral?

Modern development environments increasingly depend on ephemeral infrastructure.
Databases shouldn’t be an exception

**PG Ephemeral helps you:**

- Create isolated PostgreSQL instances in milliseconds
- Run tests without affecting your real DB

- Seed with custom schemas or migrations
- Destroy automatically when done
- Integrate with local tools, cloud environments, or containers

It’s lightweight, fast, and designed for modern workflows.
